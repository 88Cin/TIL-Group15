    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on its importance, a variety of car following models are put forward trying to model such phenomenon. However, different models are based on different assumptions, formulations and methodologies, which entails real-world data to test their limitations and advantages, for instance, some of them can't account for some specific car following patterns. Nowadays, with preprocessed real-world car following data, we are able to calibrate the car following phenomana better and more precisely.\n",
    "Therefore, in this project the objectives are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**用提问的方式表达**\n",
    "1. Visualizing and laying exploratory descriptions on real-life car following dataset, trying to uncover the corrlations of different variables (such as headway, velocity and acceleration), in order to reveal the inspirations of how the common used car following models are formulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implementing 2 different common car following models in Python, and calibrate these models with real-world data. Using visualization and other methods to describe the advantages and disadvantages among these models. And based on latent corrlations we uncover in step 1, trying to put forward a possible correction and improvements for these models.\n",

    "\n",
    "Researching car following models is critical in transportation engineering and urban planning. These models provide insights essential for congestion management, infrastructure planning, environmental impact assessment, and safety improvement. By understanding traffic dynamics, decision-makers can optimize traffic flow, identify congestion-prone areas, and design efficient road networks. This leads to reduced emissions, energy conservation, and increased road safety. Traffic flow models also aid in public transportation optimization, enhancing services for commuters. They support data-driven decision-making and offer economic benefits by improving productivity and reducing fuel consumption. In essence, traffic flow models are invaluable tools that inform decisions, ultimately shaping sustainable urban development and improving overall quality of life."

    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Data Used\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we used car-following datasets provided in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18921.pdf), which is originally collected by autonomous vehicles (AVs) from the open Lyft level-5 dataset to study car-following behavior in mixed traffic flow. The dataset consisted of over 29,000 HV-following-AV (H-A) and 42,000 HV-following-HV (H-H) car-following segments. The dataset includes over 1000 hours of perception and motion data collected over a 4-month period from urban and suburban environments along a fixed route in Palo Alto, California. The dataset comprises approximately 170,000 scenes, with each scene spanning approximately 25 seconds. Each scene includes the movement states of perceived vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians, as well as the position and orientation of the autonomous vehicle (AV). \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, data is processed using a data processing framework that involved several steps. First, CF pairs and their raw trajectories were selected from the unlabelled dataset based on certain rules. Then, the raw data quality was assessed through anomaly analysis. The next step involved enhancing the raw data. For AVs, missing segments were filled and smooth position and speed were estimated. For HVs, missing data around 0-speed points was filled using a jerk-minimization method. Finally, vehicle size processing was performed to split the enhanced dataset into two groups: H-A and H-H.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of data processing was an enhanced dataset that had higher quality and covered diverse regimes for calibrating car-following models. The enhanced data showed a reduction in anomalies, particularly in abnormal jerk sign inversion. This processed dataset can be further used for investigating car-following behavior in mixed urban traffic and the impact of AVs on traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "With diverse algorithms, we have obtained the data of the regime of each vehicle from an enhanced dataset. In the dataset of regime of each vehicle pairs, we have considered 7 regimes: \n",
    "  1. free acceleration (Fa)\n",
    "  2. free deceleration not caused by the leading vehicle (Fd)\n",
    "  3. cruising at a desired speed (C)\n",
    "  4. acceleration following a leading vehicle (A)\n",
    "  5. deceleration following a leading vehicle (D)\n",
    "  6. constant speed following (F)\n",
    "  7. standstill (S)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset also provides the time duration of each regime as well as the combination for each car-following case id which is for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**All the steps above are already done before dataset published, thus how to impletement these process is out of scope of our project, our project focuses on visualization, modelling and calibration on car following models, using the processed data**\n"
